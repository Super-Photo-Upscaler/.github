Super Photo Upscaler turns small, noisy, or compressed images into crisp, larger files. Use subject-aware presets (Portrait, Product, Text/UI, Artwork/Logo), pre-clean JPEG artifacts, adjust edge/texture, and preview at 100% before export. Batch 2×/4× or exact sizes with naming tokens and color profiles (sRGB/Adobe RGB/P3)
